    "# Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC)\n",
    "**Developed by**: Itzamna Huerta, for the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development (ANHD)  \n",
    "**Created**: Feb 2025  \n",
    "**Last Updated**: 03/19/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "The Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC) is an annual report published by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), tracking changes in the costs of maintaining rent-stabilized housing. This project automates the extraction and analysis of PIOC data to support advocacy efforts, policy analysis, and preservation campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By systematically collecting and analyzing cost trends, this project provides insight into the financial pressures faced by property owners of rent-stabilized units, informing decisions on affordability policies and tenant protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to inconsistencies in the PDF text structure and formatting variations across years, certain extracted values require manual corrections. For example, in the 2023 and 2022 reports, the automated extraction misidentified the percentage change for Administrative Costs, requiring post-processing adjustments. Similarly, some 2019 values (e.g., Maintenance, Fuel, and Labor Costs) were not reliably captured through regex-based searches and had to be manually referenced against the original document. While these corrections ensure accuracy, they also highlight the limitations of text extraction methods when dealing with complex document layouts. Future improvements may involve refining text parsing logic or integrating machine learning-based entity recognition for more precise extraction.\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "<u>Extract Key Variables</u>: Identify and capture percentage changes for major cost categories:\n",
    "- Rent Stabilized Apartments increased\n",
    "- Real estate taxes\n",
    "- Insurance Costs\n",
    "- Adminstrative Costs\n",
    "- Maintenance \n",
    "- Utilities\n",
    "- Labor Costs\n",
    "- Fuel \n",
    "- Natural Gas & Fuel Oil Heat\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Standardize Data</u>: Clean and structure extracted values to ensure consistency across multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Analyze Cost Trends</u>: Compile data into a structured format for visualization and policy analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "1. Text Extraction & Preprocessing: Extract relevant text from PIOC PDF reports, clean and standardize formatting.\n",
    "2. Pattern Matching: Use regex-based searches to locate and extract percentage changes associated with key cost categories.\n",
    "3. Multi-Year Data Compilation: Iterate through multiple reports, associate extracted values with corresponding years, and consolidate into a structured dataset.\n",
    "4. Data Transformation & Visualization: Convert data into a numerical format, reshape for analysis, and prepare for visualization."

R The “Core” PIOC, which excludes the changes in fuel oil 08 PIOC by Building prices, natural gas, and steam costs, is useful for analyzing Type inflationary trends. The Core PIOC rose by 4.9% this year. R Fuel costs increased 13.8%, the highest increase of any 08 Rent Stabilized PIOC component. Hotels R Real estate taxes increased 7.1%, primarily due to a rise in assessments for Class Two properties. 09 Rent Stabilized Lofts R The Utilities component increased by 0.4%, primarily due to an increase in water and sewer costs. 09 The Core PIOC R The Price Index of Operating Costs for Rent Stabilized Apartment Buildings is projected to increase 3.2% 09 PIOC Projections next year. for 2020 10 Commensurate Rent Adjustments 12 Methodology 15 Acknowledgments 16 Appendices New York City Rent Guidelines Board (cid:129) April 18, 2019 (cid:129) Page 3\n"
