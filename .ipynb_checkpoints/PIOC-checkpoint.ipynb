      " New York City Rent Guidelines Board 2024 Price Index of Operating Costs 04 Introduction What’s New 04 Overview R The Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC) for buildings that contain rent stabilized apartments increased 3.9% this year. PIOC Components - 05 Apartments R Real estate taxes rose by 3.2% primarily due to a rise in the tax rate for Class 2 properties. PIOC by Building 08 R Insurance costs rose by the greatest proportion in this Type year’s PIOC, 21.7%. R The Administrative costs component rose 4.6%. 08 Hotel PIOC R The Maintenance component increased by 3.5%. 09 Loft PIOC R The Utilities component increased by 1.3%. R The Labor Costs component increased by 4.3%, due to 09 The Core PIOC increases in wages for both union and non-union labor. R The Fuel component was the only component to PIOC Projections decrease, falling by 7.1%. 10 for 2025 R Overall costs in natural-gas heated buildings increased 3.8%, while overall costs in fuel-oil heated buildings Commensurate 10 increased 3.9%. Rent Adjustments R The “Core” PIOC, which excludes the changes in fuel oil prices, natural gas and steam costs, rose by 4.9% this year. 12 Methodology R Costs in Pre-1974 buildings rose 3.6%, while costs in Post- 1973 rose 5.3%. 15 Acknowledgments R The PIOC for buildings that contain rent stabilized apartments is projected to increase 4.4% next year. 17 Appendices New York City Rent Guidelines Board • April 18, 2024 • Page 3\n"
