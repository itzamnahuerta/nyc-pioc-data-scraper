    "# Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC)\n",
    "**Developed by**: Itzamna Huerta, for the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development (ANHD)  \n",

    "**Last Updated**: N/A  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "The Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC) is an annual report published by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (RGB), tracking changes in the costs of maintaining rent-stabilized housing. This project automates the extraction and analysis of PIOC data to support advocacy efforts, policy analysis, and preservation campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By systematically collecting and analyzing cost trends, this project provides insight into the financial pressures faced by property owners of rent-stabilized units, informing decisions on affordability policies and tenant protections.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "<u>Extract Key Variables</u>: Identify and capture percentage changes for major cost categories:\n",
    "- Rent Stabilized Apartments increased\n",
    "- Real estate taxes\n",
    "- Insurance Costs\n",
    "- Adminstrative Costs\n",
    "- Maintenance \n",

    "- Labor Costs\n",
    "- Fuel \n",
    "- Natural Gas & Fuel Oil Heat\n",
    "- Costs in Pre-1974 Buildings\n",
    "- Buildings that contain ret stabilized apartments\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Standardize Data</u>: Clean and structure extracted values to ensure consistency across multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Analyze Cost Trends</u>: Compile data into a structured format for visualization and policy analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "1. Text Extraction & Preprocessing: Extract relevant text from PIOC PDF reports, clean and standardize formatting.\n",
    "2. Pattern Matching: Use regex-based searches to locate and extract percentage changes associated with key cost categories.\n",
    "3. Multi-Year Data Compilation: Iterate through multiple reports, associate extracted values with corresponding years, and consolidate into a structured dataset.\n",
    "4. Data Transformation & Visualization: Convert data into a numerical format, reshape for analysis, and prepare for visualization."

      " New York City Rent Guidelines Board 2024 Price Index of Operating Costs 04 Introduction What’s New 04 Overview R The Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC) for buildings that contain rent stabilized apartments increased 3.9% this year. PIOC Components - 05 Apartments R Real estate taxes rose by 3.2% primarily due to a rise in the tax rate for Class 2 properties. PIOC by Building 08 R Insurance costs rose by the greatest proportion in this Type year’s PIOC, 21.7%. R The Administrative costs component rose 4.6%. 08 Hotel PIOC R The Maintenance component increased by 3.5%. 09 Loft PIOC R The Utilities component increased by 1.3%. R The Labor Costs component increased by 4.3%, due to 09 The Core PIOC increases in wages for both union and non-union labor. R The Fuel component was the only component to PIOC Projections decrease, falling by 7.1%. 10 for 2025 R Overall costs in natural-gas heated buildings increased 3.8%, while overall costs in fuel-oil heated buildings Commensurate 10 increased 3.9%. Rent Adjustments R The “Core” PIOC, which excludes the changes in fuel oil prices, natural gas and steam costs, rose by 4.9% this year. 12 Methodology R Costs in Pre-1974 buildings rose 3.6%, while costs in Post- 1973 rose 5.3%. 15 Acknowledgments R The PIOC for buildings that contain rent stabilized apartments is projected to increase 4.4% next year. 17 Appendices New York City Rent Guidelines Board • April 18, 2024 • Page 3\n"
